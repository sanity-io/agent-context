## About `_index.md`

The `_index.md` file in this directory is an **agent navigation file** for the `create-agent-with-sanity-context` skill. It provides a structured index that helps AI agents understand the codebase and find relevant files without loading everything into context.

This file is synced (along with the rest of this example) to `skills/create-agent-with-sanity-context/references/ecommerce/` via the `pnpm sync-skill-example` script. Human-facing README files are excluded from that sync.
